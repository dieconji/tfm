# An√°lisis predictivo del comportamiento de los clientes en sus interacciones con la empresa

Abstract:

Customers communicate with companies through several ways (e.g., phone, web, mobile applications, social networks, e-mail...). The purpose of these interactions can be for different reasons, for example:
  - Obtaining information on products and prices.
  - Consulting invoices.
  - Making claims for any problem with their service.
  - Contracting new products or services.
  - Modifying any terms of existing contracts.
  - Terminating the contract itself.

Companies usually have CRM systems which manage interactions with existing and potential customers. An important feature of these systems is that they allow information to be collected from the different channels.

In the case of large companies with millions of customers, processing all this data can be very complex and slow, but there are massive processing technologies such as parallel computing that allow to reduce time considerably.

The log of user interactions can be analyzed to understand their preferences and needs, so companies can improve business relationships with their customers and therefore, provide a better customer experience.

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms can be used to influence business decision making. For example, predictive analytics can lead to increase cross-selling and customer retention. In addition, all these improvements could have an impact on the reduction of operating costs derived from the impact of telephone calls to the call center.
